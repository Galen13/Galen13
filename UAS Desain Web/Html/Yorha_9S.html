                <h2>YoRHa 9S</h2>

                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>9S has short, silver hair and wears the standard YoRHa uniform for male units, which includes a black blindfold visor. His outfit is generally neater and less battle-worn than 2B's or A2's.</p>
                
                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>9S is curious, friendly, and more emotionally expressive than 2B. He shows a keen interest in human culture and history. As the story progresses, his experiences lead to significant changes in his personality and outlook.</p>
                
                <h3>Abilities</h3>
                <p>As a scanner model, 9S specializes in hacking. He can hack into enemies to damage or control them, and can also hack into various systems and machines to gather information. While not as combat-oriented as 2B or A2, he is still proficient in battle.</p>
